<p><b>What is the Web</b></p>

<p>The Web is made of HTML Documents and is the basis for all web pages.<br>

- You<br>
- Your Computer + Browser<br>
- The Internet<br>
- Servers</p>

<p><b>What is HTML?</b><br>
Definition: HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> forms what you see on the Web<br>
- Text Content or what you see<br>
- Markup or how it looks<br>

<p><b>What is HTML Markup?</b><br>
- HTML markup is made up of <b>"tags"</b> and <b>"elements."</b><br>
- The tags and the content in between the tags makes up the <b>ELEMENT</b>.<br>
- Some common tags that go between < and > include:<br><br>

1. B tag (bold)<br>
2. EM tag (italics)<br>
3. A tag (anchor tag for making links)<br>
4. IMG tag (images)<br>
5. ALT tag (alternate text to more clearly define in words what an image is about - often used for broken requests or for the blind<br>
6. BR tag (break tag) which is an <b><em>INLINE</em></b> tag.<br>
7. P tag (paragraph tag) which is a <b><em>BLOCK</em></b> tag.<br>
<br>
<b>**Note**</b>: INLINE and BLOCK tags form an <em>invisible</em> box around the text/content.

<p><b>What are HTML Attributes?</b><br>
- HTML attributes (attr) go inside of tags to change things such as font size, color, etc.</p>
